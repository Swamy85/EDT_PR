# Alcohol Detection Car Locking System

## 📘 Project Type
Final Year Documentation-Based Project

## 📄 Project Description
This project proposes an alcohol detection system designed to prevent road accidents caused by drunk driving. It outlines a practical solution that integrates an **MQ3 alcohol sensor**, **Arduino Mega microcontroller**, and **DC motor** to monitor a driver's breath.

When alcohol levels exceed a predefined threshold, the system automatically:
- Locks the vehicle’s engine
- Activates an emergency siren

This system aims to enhance road safety by restricting access to vehicle operation when alcohol is detected.

## 🛠️ Tools and Components Used
- MQ3 Alcohol Sensor
- Arduino Mega
- DC Motor
- Embedded C (for Arduino programming)
- Optional: Face Lock Application for Anti-Cheating

## 📂 Project Files Included
- Project Report (PDF)
- Abstract
- Presentation Slides (PPT)
- System Block Diagram (Image)
- References and Bibliography
- Circuit Explanation
- Component Description Sheet

## ✅ Key Features
- Real-time alcohol detection
- Automatic engine lock mechanism
- Emergency alert activation
- Affordable and effective
- Anti-cheating suggestions using biometric verification

## 🧠 Objective
To build a cost-effective alcohol detection system that prevents vehicle ignition when alcohol is detected in the driver’s breath, ensuring both **public** and **personal road safety**.
