# 🚗 Alcohol Detection Car Locking System

## 📘 Project Type
Final Year Documentation-Based Project  
**Branch**: Computer Science & Engineering  
**Institution**: Vardhaman College of Engineering, JNTUH

## 📄 Project Description
This project proposes an **Alcohol Detection System** to reduce road accidents caused by drunk driving. The system integrates:

- **MQ3 Alcohol Sensor** (to detect alcohol from breath)
- **Arduino Mega** (to process data and control actions)
- **DC Motor** (represents the car engine)

When alcohol concentration exceeds a predefined threshold, the system:

- 🔒 **Locks the vehicle’s engine**
- 🚨 **Triggers an emergency siren**

This ensures the driver cannot operate the vehicle under the influence of alcohol, promoting **public safety**.

## 🧠 Objective
To design and implement a cost-effective embedded system that prevents a vehicle from starting if alcohol is detected in the driver's breath.

---

## ✅ Key Features
- 🔍 Real-time alcohol level monitoring
- 🔒 Automatic engine locking
- 🚨 Emergency siren activation
- 💸 Low-cost and easy-to-implement
- 🧠 Anti-cheating prevention with optional biometric (face lock)
